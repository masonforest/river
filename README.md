# River

**NOTE: River is a work in progress and should be considered _extremely_ beta.**

River is a general-purpose HTTP client with eventual hopes of full HTTP/2 support (along with support for HTTP/1.1). It is built from the ground up with three major goals:

1. be fully compliant with [RFC 7540](http://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html)
2. be simple and straightforward to use, in the vein of HTTPoison
3. be awesome, in the same way that Go's http library (which has built-in, transparent support for `HTTP/2`) is awesome.

## Installation

1. Add River to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:
```elixir
def deps do
  [{:river, "~> 0.0.6"}]
end
```

2. Ensure River is started before your application:
```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:river]]
end
```

## Caveats

1. Currently, River only knows how to make `HTTP/2` requests to `https://` endpoints. Soon, I'll add the ability to make a request via the Upgrade header so that requests to `http://` endpoints will work as well.
2. River doesn't currently speak `HTTP/1.x`. Once I finish up basic `HTTP/2` support, `HTTP1.x` is next on the roadmap. The goal when using River in your project is that you should not need to know whether the underlying connection is using `HTTP/2` or `HTTP/1.x`.
3. River is as beta as it gets, and under active development with no promises of anything being backwards compatible ðŸ˜¬ (until we hit `v1.0`, of course)

## Goals

- [x] Basic HTTP/2 support
- [ ] HTTP/1 --> HTTP/2 upgrading
- [ ] Full HTTP/2 support
- [ ] Full HTTP/1.x support

## Basic Usage

#### Simple GET
```elixir
River.Client.get("https://http2.golang.org/")
=> {:ok,
 %River.Response{__status: :ok,
  body: "<html>\n<body>\n<h1>Go...",
  closed: true, code: 200, content_type: "text/html; charset=utf-8",
  headers: headers: [{":status", "200"},
                     {"content-type", "text/html; charset=utf-8"},
                     {"content-length", "1708"},
                     {"date", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 04:26:34 GMT"}]}}
```

#### Simple PUT
```elixir
River.Client.put("https://example.com/", "hello world")
=> {:ok, %River.Response{...}}
```

#### Request with timeout
```elixir
# timeout unit is milliseconds
River.Client.get("https://http2.golang.org/", timeout: 10)
=> {:error, :timeout}
```
